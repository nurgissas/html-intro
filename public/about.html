<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Nurgissa, 3rd year of undergraduate university KAIST of CS and BS departments. I am interested in Full-Stack Development, so I am doing so.</p>

<p>I really enjoy coding and writing algorithms, so I am passionate about writing this line too. Besides studies, I take great interest in soccer, table tennis, volleyball, basketball, running, reading, drawing. I have a page on Pinterest where I post most of my drawings to inspire others.</p>

<p>My favourite quote: nothing beats genius like hard work</p>
